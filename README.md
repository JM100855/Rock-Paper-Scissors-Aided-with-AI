# ✊✋✌️ Rock Paper Scissors (AI-Aided)

This project implements the classic Rock–Paper–Scissors game with an AI-assisted opponent. The system observes player moves, tracks patterns over time, and uses them to make more informed choices instead of selecting moves randomly.

The goal is to explore basic decision-making logic and pattern recognition in a simple, interactive game setting.
